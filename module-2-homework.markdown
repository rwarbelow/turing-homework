  * Dive deep into [how the web works](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/6c166c78a3be3c8ba38545ff5e2b31ac) to prep for tomorrow's class. This might seem like a lot at first, but it shouldn't take you more than 30-45 minutes.


##### Day 2
  * CRUD either Skill Inventory or Robot World. Instructions are at the bottom of [this file](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud.markdown).
  * Add basic bootstrap and other custom styling to your Robot World or Skill Inventory. 
  * Research Capybara (a tool we'll be using tomorrow). The following resources are a good start:
   * [The Basics of Capybara and Improving your Tests](https://www.sitepoint.com/basics-capybara-improving-tests/)
   * [Capybara (software) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara_(software))
   * [Testing your App with Capybara](http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/)

##### Day 3

  * Read the "What is Rack" section (just the first one) in this [article](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2013/04/02/whats-rack/). 
  * Read [What is 'Rack' in Ruby/Rails?](http://blog.gauravchande.com/what-is-rack-in-ruby-rails)
  * Work through the [Fundamental SQL](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html) tutorial in preparation for tomorrow. This should take approximately 40 minutes. Come with questions.

##### Day 4
  * Transform Skill Inventory or Robot World to use Sqlite3. You'll continue working on this over the weekend. Submit the link to your repo [here](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1606-b/sinatra_crud.yml) no later than Sunday at 8pm.
  * [Optional, but Highly Suggested] Work through the [Routing Playground](https://github.com/s-espinosa/routing_playground) to learn more about Sinatra routes.

 * Get familiar with ActiveRecord by following this (very short) [tutorial](link-is-coming-soon).
 * [Watch Sharif Ramadan's intro to 1NF, 2NF and 3NF databases. They're only about 4 minutes each.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7vzLrGCV50&list=PLQ9AAKW8HuJ5m0rmHKL88ZyjOIKejvrj0)
 * Suggested:

## Week 4

##### Day 1

* Complete the [Sessions, Cookies, and Flashes](https://gist.github.com/rwarbelow/21a7596df9cdb551bb85) homework. 
* Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/134451454) on authentication to prep yourself for tomorrows lesson. 

##### Day 2
  * Authentication in ToolChest: Add functionality so that a user has many tools and a tool belongs to a user. A user can login and logout. A logged-in user can only see his/her tools.
  * Modify your `most_recent_tool` helper method to return that specific user's most recent tool added. 
  * Add a belongs-to/has-many association between `tool` and `category`. You **do not** need to create CRUD functionality for categories so long as categories can be created from `rails c` and the form to create a new tool allows the user to select a category. You will need to do some Googling in order to figure out how to insert a select dropdown into a form. 

##### Day 3

User: 
 * can view index and show page for tools that belong to self
 * cannot update users besides self
 * cannot create see or update other users tools
 * can see a category show page with all associated tools
 * cannot create, update, or delete categories

Admin: 
 * can create, update, read, and delete tools. When creating a tool they must assign it to a default user. 
 * cannot update users besides self
 * can CRUD categories

* Experimenting with APIs: Work through [this tutorial and workshop](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/exploring_apis.markdown) which will prepare you for extensions in your Rails Mini-Project and Little Shop.
